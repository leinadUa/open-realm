# OpenWarcraft Agent Guide

## Project Context

This codebase is inspired by **Quake 2** (id Software). The developer is deeply familiar with Quake 2's architecture and source code. **Quake 2 is the primary reference** for all lifecycle, state communication, UI control, movement, and entity patterns. Use **Quake 3** as a secondary reference for features Q2 lacks, such as client-side UI libraries or renderer module separation.

## Coding Style

- Follow the C coding style used in the Quake 2 source code (id Software style).
- Use the same patterns for module organization, data structures, and naming conventions as in Quake 2.
- Prefer simple, flat, and data-oriented design over complex object-oriented abstractions.
- Keep the code readable, compact, and close to the metal — minimize unnecessary indirection.
- **No hacks.** Every implementation must have a solid reasoning. If a shortcut is taken, mark it with `/* HACK: */` or `/* TODO: */` and explain *why* the proper fix is not yet possible. Silent fallbacks are forbidden.
- **Never guess at a bug fix.** Before writing any fix, add targeted `fprintf(stderr, ...)` logs at the exact code paths in question, run the binary with `+com_frame_limit N` to capture a bounded log, read the output, and confirm the root cause from evidence. Only then write the fix and remove the logs. A fix written without log evidence is a guess and will be reverted. If the existing CLI tools (`mpqtool`, `dbctool`, `mdxtool`) cannot answer the question, extend them or add a new tool rather than guessing. The tools in `build/bin/` exist precisely because guessing at asset/data problems wastes time.
- **Use `git blame` when investigating history.** When a value, macro, or code path seems wrong, use `git blame` or `git log -p -S <pattern>` to find when and why it was introduced. The commit message and diff often explain the original intent, distinguishing a deliberate trade-off from an accidental value or copy-paste left-over.
- **Write as little code as possible.** Prefer smart tricks and reuse of existing code over writing new functions. When Quake code style leads to verbose vertical expansion, override it with denser, shorter forms: pack related statements on one line, use ternary/comma for conditional side effects, omit braces for single-statement bodies, and collapse trivial helpers into one-liners.
- For trusted binary game data, prefer memory-mapped/file-shaped structs with trailing arrays wherever possible. Read the blob, allocate/copy it as one block if ownership is needed, and point consumers at that struct instead of decoding, cropping, or post-processing into parallel runtime arrays.
- Prefer table-driven parsing for keyed/text formats such as XML, FDF, catalogs, and similar game data. Define a small schema table first, for example `{ name, offsetof(struct, field), type }`, then run one generic parser over that table. This is also called data-driven or array-driven parsing: the field mapping is data, and the parser is a tiny machine that applies it.
- Prefer format-driven parsing when the data has a fixed syntax. Configure the parser with the format and launch it, for example `sscanf(text, "%f,%f,%f", ...)` for SC2 comma-separated vectors, instead of hand-writing character walkers, separator loops, and ad hoc token logic.
- Do not bury schema in long manual `if`/`else` or `switch` ladders when a compact table can describe the same work. Put the mapping beside the target struct, keep the interpreter small, and let adding a field mean adding one table row instead of adding custom logic in the parser body.
- Do not use several booleans to represent mutually exclusive state. If only one mode/kind/type can be active, define and pass an enum, then dispatch from that enum. For example, use one `sc2ObjectType_t` value instead of separate `is_unit`, `is_doodad`, and `is_camera` flags.
- Put pure, reusable local helpers in a small nearby utils header, such as `sc2_utils.h`, as `static` functions. Keep subsystem-owned helpers that touch globals, allocation hosts, file handles, or runtime state in the `.c` file that owns that state.
- Write tiny parsing/utility helpers only when they remove real duplication or clarify a call site. Keep them brutally short; prefer simple standard C library calls (`strchr`, `strspn`, `strtoul`, etc.) over hand-written multi-line loops unless the format genuinely requires custom logic. Do not add ceremonial blank lines inside tiny helpers, and keep trivial statement bodies on one line when that is clearer, e.g. `if (*p == '"') quoted = !quoted;`. Avoid temporary success variables for tiny wrappers; branch directly on the call and return explicit `true`/`false` when that is shorter and clearer.
- Follow a strict Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) rule: do not duplicate logic or repeat the same data literal in multiple places. If the same path/key/constant appears more than once (for example `Interface\\GlueXML\\AccountLogin.xml`), centralize it as one named constant or one shared loader path and reuse it.
- Keep runtime structs concise and organized by grouping related fields and repeated shapes.
- Prefer small helper structs for repeated concepts (for example point/size/color groups) instead of repeating scalar fields across large structs.
- When several fields share the same type and semantic family, declare them together on one line (for example `int id, parent, relative_to, draw_layer;` or `fsize_t size, edge, tile;`).
- For many same-kind string fields, prefer enum-indexed arrays plus tiny access helpers over many separate named string members.
- Avoid fixed-size inline string buffers in runtime structs when the data is variable-length. Prefer owned pointers with one clear setter/append/free path.
- Prefer bit flags (`DWORD flags`) for many independent boolean properties instead of scattering many standalone `BOOL` fields. Even 2-3 related booleans should become a flags byte with named constants (e.g. `BACKDROP_TILE | BACKDROP_MIRRORED`).
- Test flag membership with implicit bool conversion: `flags & FLAG` not `(flags & FLAG) != 0`.
- Group related fields into anonymous structs inspired by CSS shorthands. Example: `struct { LPCTEXTURE texture; COLOR32 color; } bg, edge;` instead of `bg_texture`, `edge_texture`, `bg_color`, `edge_color`. Similarly `struct { FLOAT right, top, bottom, left; } insets;` instead of `bg_insets[4]`.
- Keep struct field ownership explicit: pair every dynamic struct field family with local helpers for set/append/free and use one cleanup loop when possible.
- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables, `ALL_CAPS` for constants and macros, matching Quake 2 conventions.
- Use the `BZ_` prefix for project-private compile-time macros, generated binding helpers, environment toggles, and namespaced constants that need a project prefix.
- When fixing warnings for short, future-facing hooks such as one-line static moves, extern declarations, or placeholder assignments, prefer commenting them out over deleting them. Add a short comment explaining the warning being fixed and when the line should come back, for example that Linux `-Wall` warns while the hook is unused.
- For WoW UI code (`games/world-of-warcraft/ui/`), do not fail silently. When a required script, handler, renderer resource, or fallback path is missing, emit a clear `UIWow:` log that explains what was skipped and why. Prefer one-time warnings for per-frame paths to avoid log spam.
- When a function has more than 3 parameters, group them into a dedicated input struct rather than adding more arguments. Name the struct `draw<Thing>_t` or `<thing>Params_t` in the public header. This applies to renderer API functions, game import/export callbacks, and similar cross-module interfaces.

## General
- Minimize vertical space. Prefer fewer, denser lines over many short ones.
- Keep C source lines at or under 120 characters. Single-statement helpers may stay on one line when they fit,
  but do not chain long runs of API calls or argument-heavy expressions horizontally.
- Single-statement functions go on one line: `int f(void) { return 0; }`
- Omit braces for single-statement `if`/`else`/`while` bodies.
- Keep control-flow keywords at the start of their own line in normal code paths. Do not write chained forms like `...; if (...)` or `...; while (...)` on the same physical line.
- Add a short comment before each non-trivial function describing why it exists and what it does — not a restatement of the name, but the constraint or contract that isn't obvious from the signature alone.
- For any fallback, workaround, or partial implementation, prepend `/* HACK: */` or `/* TODO: */` and explain *why* the fallback is needed (what asset/variant is missing, what upstream bug forces it, or what the proper fix would be). Never leave a silent fallback undocumented.
- When providing a bug fix, add an inline comment at the fix site explaining *why* the fix is correct and what the original behaviour was. This is especially important when restoring behaviour that existed in an older version of the code or when the fix is non-obvious from the surrounding context (e.g. a state gate that was too restrictive). The comment should help a future reader understand the constraint, not just describe what the code does.

## Packing multiple statements
- Chain sequential, logically related statements on one line with `;`:
  `lua_pushvalue(L, 2); lua_pushvalue(L, 1);`
- Stop packing when the line would exceed 120 characters or when the calls form a list of similar operations.
  In those cases, use one operation per line or a small table/helper so the repetition reads vertically.
- Merge declarations that belong to the same logical step:
  `int key_idx = lua_absindex(L, -2), val_idx = lua_absindex(L, -1);`

## Ternary + comma operator for conditional initialization
- When an assignment depends on a condition that also has side effects, use
  the comma operator inside the ternary branch to keep it a single expression:
```c
  int nargs = lua_isnoneornil(L, 2) ? 1 : (lua_pushvalue(L, 2), lua_xmove(L, co, 1), 2);
```
  The comma operator sequences the side-effect calls; the branch evaluates to
  the final value. Use this to avoid splitting a variable's initialization from
  its declaration.

## Braces
- Omit braces when the body is a single statement or a single comma-chained expression.
- Keep braces for multi-statement `while` bodies, and anything
  that would become ambiguous without them.

## Pointers and casts
- Inline pointer-through-cast writes where the intent is clear:
  `*((struct Object **)lua_getextraspace(L)) = self;`

## WinAPI-style Typedefs for Structs
- Struct names are ALL CAPS, short, and descriptive (e.g., `PORTRAITFOG`, `PORTRAITDEF`). No `_t` suffix.
- Use WinAPI-style `LP`/`LPC` typedefs for struct pointer types (e.g., `LPCPORTRAITDEF`, `LPRECT`).
- `LP` = long pointer (non-const), `LPC` = long pointer to const.
- Define both in `tr_public.h` alongside the struct, using separate `typedef` lines so `LPC` is `const struct *`:
  ```c
  typedef struct _PORTRAITFOG {
      BOOL has_fog;
      COLOR32 fog_color;
      FLOAT fog_near;
      FLOAT fog_far;
  } PORTRAITFOG, *PPORTRAITFOG;
  typedef PORTRAITFOG const *LPCPORTRAITFOG;
  ```
- Use these typedefs in function signatures and call sites rather than bare `struct foo *`.

## What to avoid
- Do not introduce helper variables just to name an intermediate result if the
  expression is already readable inline.
- Do not add blank lines between short, related statements.
- Do not split a declaration and its first assignment onto separate lines.
- Do not add null-pointer or function-pointer guards before calling cross-module API functions (`ui.*`, `re.*`, `s.*`, etc.). These are guaranteed to be set at init time and should be called directly.

## Tool Failures

- **If a tool fails repeatedly, stop and notify the user.** When a tool (terminal, build command, test runner, etc.) fails more than 2-3 times with the same error, do not keep retrying blindly or switch to purely static analysis. Instead, inform the user what is failing and why, propose a workaround (e.g. redirecting output to a file, running in background), and ask whether to continue with the workaround or wait for the user's help. Wasting time fighting a tool instead of asking for help is worse than a brief interruption.

## Test Discipline

- **Every structural change must include or update tests.** When you add a new function, change a behavior path, fix a bug, or modify a struct/API contract, check whether existing tests cover the change. If they do not, add a test before or alongside the change.
- **New code paths need new tests.** If you add an `if` branch, a new function, a new field, or a new cache/state machine, write a test that exercises the new path and its inverse (hit + miss, success + failure, zero + non-zero).
- **Cache/state-machine changes double-test.** When changing a caching layer or state machine, test both cache hit and cache miss paths, and verify performance counters (`cache_hits`, `cache_misses`, etc.) where the implementation tracks them.
- **Run `make test` before committing.** The WC3 test binary (`test_openwarcraft3`) includes all unit tests. If the full suite takes too long, run individual test suites first (by temporarily commenting out other suites in the runner), but verify the full suite passes before finalising the change.
- **`git blame` before changing existing struct/API fields.** Use `git blame` or `git log -p -S <pattern>` to understand why a field exists, what trade-offs were made, and whether your change is consistent with the original intent. This is especially important for network-contract structs (`entityState_t`, `playerState_t`), engine APIs, and cache keys — see the "Engine Struct/API Discipline" section above.
- **Do not disable a failing test.** If a test fails, fix the code or fix the test — do not comment it out, add `SKIP`, or reduce its coverage. A failing test that is expected to pass is a bug report; a test that is wrong describes the wrong contract.

## Architecture

- Structure the project similarly to Quake 2: separate modules for rendering, game logic, input, sound, networking, etc.
- Game state should be managed in a straightforward, imperative style consistent with Quake 2's `g_*.c` / `cl_*.c` / `r_*.c` file layout.
- The engine and game code may be separated (similar to Quake 2's `game.dll` / `ref_gl` split) to allow modular replacement of subsystems.
- Runtime modules communicate through function tables (`R_GetAPI`, `UI_GetAPI`, game imports/exports). Prefer this boundary over direct cross-module dependencies.
- Use cvars for runtime choices: `r_module`, `ui_module`, `g_module`, and `com_frame_limit`.

## Server-Authoring Pattern (Quake 2 STAT_LAYOUTS)

- The server controls what the client draws and does, via state bits in `playerState_t`. The client just reads them.
- `uiflags` bitmask hides layout layers: each bit corresponds to a `UILAYOUTLAYER` value. Server sets bits to hide layers, client checks `(1 << layer) & uiflags`.
- `client_ui_state` enum (`CLIENT_UI_GAME`, `CLIENT_UI_LOADING`, `CLIENT_UI_CINEMATIC`) controls broad client modes: loading screen, cutscene panel, gameplay HUD.
- Never hardcode game-mode-specific skip logic in the client. The server sets the appropriate flags; the client respects them.
- Follow Quake 2's pattern: `STAT_LAYOUTS` bits control layout visibility, `STAT_SPECTATOR`/`STAT_CHASE` control mode, `pm_type` controls movement. Same idea, different field names.

## Mouse Input Architecture

- Mouse state is owned by the client: the `mouse` global (`mouseEvent_t` in `client/cl_input.c`) is the single source of truth for position, button, event, and wheel state.
- The UI library receives mouse events via `ui.MouseEvent(x, y, button, down)` — a push-based model called during `SDL_PollEvent` in `CL_Input()`. The UI processes events immediately (hit test + action).
- Game-mode-specific mouse behavior (camera pan, selection, zoom) lives in per-game `cl_input_<game>.c` files via the `CL_InputMode*` functions.
- Never create a separate mouse state struct in game UI code. Never poll mouse event state during draw — process events in the event handler instead.

## UI Module Boundary

- Keep `ui.dll` focused on loading screens, menu/glue UI, and client-side in-game HUD screens.
- In-game HUD panels are drawn by client-side screen controllers under `ui/screens/` (e.g. `console_ui.c`). These load FDF from Blizzard's MPQ archives at runtime via `UI_EnsureFDF()` and draw through `UI_DrawFrames()`. They read game state through `uiimport.GetPlayerState()` and receive unit selection updates via the `update_unit_ui` callback.
- Do not add UI import callbacks for mouse polling, loading state polling, layout decoding, or Warcraft III map-info helpers. Use pushed `MouseEvent`/`LayoutMouseEvent`, `DrawLoadingScreen(map, status, progress)`, client-owned layout functions, and direct `CM_*` map-info calls inside the UI module.
- Loading-screen ownership stays with `ca_loading`. Snapshot parsing may update `playerstate`, but it must not promote `cls.state` to `ca_active`.
- The client may only enter `ca_active` from the precache/load-completion gate in `CL_PrepRefresh()` after all required assets are registered and the client has sent its `begin` command. If a loading plaque vanishes early and the screen goes black, fix the state transition, not the renderer.

### stb_fdf.h Pattern

- `stb_fdf.h` is the shared declarations-only header for FDF types (`FRAMEDEF`, enums, bind macros) and API declarations (`UI_ParseFDF`, `UI_DrawFrames`, etc.).
- Parser implementation stays in `ui_fdf.c` (has `uiimport` dependency for MPQ asset loading). `stb_fdf.h` provides shared types + declarations so both modules see identical structs without circular includes.
- Generated binding headers in `generated/` map FDF field names to struct member offsets via macros like `bind_<fieldname>`. Use `fdfbindgen` tool to regenerate from MPQ source FDF files.
- Both the UI module (`games/warcraft-3/ui/generated/`) and the game module (`games/warcraft-3/game/generated/`) have generated FDF binding headers. UI generated headers include `"../ui_local.h"`, game generated headers include `"../g_local.h"`.
- Screen controllers in `ui/screens/` follow the pattern: one `*_Load()` that calls `UI_EnsureFDF()`, one `*_Bind()` that wires FDF children to struct fields, and a `uiScreen_t` definition with `load/init/refresh/draw/shutdown/update_unit_ui` callbacks.

### Server-Authoring HUD (`game/hud/`)

The server-authored gameplay HUD lives in `games/warcraft-3/game/hud/`, split by concern:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `hud_local.h` | Shared constants, layout macros, and function prototypes for all HUD files |
| `hud_write.c` | Frame-write primitives (`UI_WriteProxyFrame`, `UI_WriteTextFrame`, etc.), theme lookup, text formatting |
| `hud_console.c` | ConsoleUI backdrop textures, minimap viewport, resource bar (gold/lumber/supply/upkeep) |
| `hud_commands.c` | Command button grid, build queue, inventory buttons, tooltip formatting |
| `hud_infopanel.c` | Single-unit info panel, multi-select grid, per-frame HP/mana change detection, stubs for client-side console_ui.c |
| `hud_quests.c` | Quest dialog overlay with list items, objectives, show/hide |
| `hud_cinematic.c` | Cinematic letterbox bars, portrait model, speaker/dialogue text, interface toggle, message overlay, layer clear |

The FDF→uiframe bridge (`UI_WriteFrame`, `UI_WriteLayout`, etc.) stays in `hud/hud.c` alongside the `frames[]` global registry. Skills and server code call into HUD functions via `g_local.h` declarations.

## Network State Contracts

- Do not casually add fields to `entityState_t`. It is a network snapshot/delta contract, so every new field increases protocol surface, bandwidth, baseline/delta behavior, save/load assumptions, and renderer/client coupling. Adding a field must be extremely well justified and should only happen after considering narrower alternatives such as existing state fields, configstrings, typed UI payloads, game-side state, or explicit commands.

## Engine Struct/API Discipline

- Follow Quake/id-style engine discipline: keep core structs and module APIs small, stable, and data-oriented. Do not add fields to engine structs or function tables unless the existing contract truly cannot express the required state.
- Before adding new engine/game machinery, first check how Quake 2 handled the closest similar problem. Prefer its established channels and lifecycles: configstrings/media registration, snapshots and player/entity state, usercmds, cvars, console commands, game/client/ref import-export tables, renderer-owned caches, and default/null media.
- If a Quake-style analogue exists, follow it instead of inventing a new subsystem, side cache, struct field, API parameter, or global. If the project must differ because RTS/Warcraft data genuinely requires it, keep the change narrow and explain the specific mismatch.
- Before adding a field, prove why existing channels are insufficient. Prefer existing state such as `entityState_t.image`, renderer-side `renderEntity_t.skin`, configstrings, cvars, command strings, function-table parameters already in use, or data-driven metadata.
- Avoid adding parallel fields that duplicate derived state. If a value can be resolved from an existing ID, configstring, asset record, or cache entry, keep the derived value local to the subsystem that owns the cache.
- Do not widen network or renderer contracts for a single asset bug. In particular, avoid adding one-off fields to `entityState_t`, `playerState_t`, `renderEntity_t`, `uiFrameDef_t`, or import/export APIs unless there is a general engine requirement.
- Do not fix data-driven asset problems with hardcoded asset IDs, terrain/tree enums, campaign-specific literals, or special-case paths in engine code. Inspect the source asset format and object metadata first, then implement the generic processing path.
- Keep on-disk/file-format structs conceptually separate from runtime structs. If a runtime struct has extra fields, do not use `sizeof(runtime_struct)` as the serialized record size; parse/write the file format explicitly.
- When a UI or renderer bug is caused by cache timing, prefer fixing the cache invalidation/resolution layer over storing duplicate path/name fields on every frame or draw object.
- Do not add workaround side tables beside authoritative engine state. If Quake 2/3 would keep using configstrings, registration handles, renderer caches, null/default assets, cvars, or commands, do the same. For example, do not add global `failed_*` arrays to remember asset load failures next to configstrings; fix the registration/cache/renderer fallback path that owns asset loading.
- Before adding any "remember this failed" cache, check the analogous Quake 2/3 path first. If id-tech solved it through registration lifecycle, cache ownership, default media, or clearing state on map/ref changes, follow that pattern instead of creating a new client/game side workaround.
- Treat API and struct growth as a last resort. If a change adds fields, the review explanation should say why a smaller Quake-style solution using existing state was not enough.
- Treat increases to shared engine constants and packet/entity budgets as a last resort. Large RTS maps and doodad/tree counts are expected data, especially in Warcraft III; do not raise caps to paper over visibility, culling, lifetime, sorting, or synchronization bugs until the real bottleneck has been proven and narrower data-driven or lifecycle fixes have been exhausted.
- When replacing a single existing line or macro call with a larger custom block, keep the original line commented out immediately above the replacement and add a short comment explaining why the expansion is necessary, such as a file-format mismatch, bug fix, or new feature behavior.
- Do not hardcode values that are likely to exist in source game data, map files, catalog XML/DBC/SLK/FDF/etc., asset metadata, or other inspectable formats. Inspect the data first and parse the authoritative field. If a temporary literal is genuinely unavoidable, mark it with a `BZ_HARDCODED_DATA_FALLBACK` comment that names the expected source file/field and the reason it is not parsed yet.

## Engine/Game Boundary (Strict)

- Engine modules (`renderer/`, `client/`, `common/`, `server/` core paths) must remain game-agnostic.
- Never hardcode game-specific asset names, animation names, frame names, map/script conventions, or franchise-specific literals in engine code.
- Examples of forbidden engine literals: specific sequence names like `"MainMenu Stand"`, specific UI roots, or title-specific asset assumptions.
- If behavior needs title/game knowledge, put that policy in the selected game source tree under `games/<game>/` and pass generic parameters into engine APIs.
- Game-owned sources live under `games/warcraft-3/`, `games/world-of-warcraft/`, and `games/starcraft-2/`, with `game/`, `renderer/`, and, where present, `ui/` subdirectories. Warcraft III also owns `jass/`, `sheet/`, and `tests/` under `games/warcraft-3/`. The Makefile still exposes friendly targets such as `game`, `renderer`, and `ui` for the default Warcraft III build.
- The renderer library is a compound module: engine renderer sources in `renderer/` are compiled together with the selected game's `games/<game>/renderer/` sources. Engine renderer code calls the `R_Game*` API declared in `renderer/r_game.h`; it must not switch on MDX/M2/M3 model formats or include game renderer internals directly.
- Prefer generic fallbacks in engine code (caller-provided names, first available sequence, data-driven metadata) rather than title-specific heuristics.

## Build And Linking

- Never add `DYLIB_LOOKUP := -Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup` or otherwise rely on `-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup` in this repository.
- If a target has unresolved symbols, fix the dependency graph or shared implementation instead of weakening the linker contract.

## Missing Asset Placeholders

Follow Quake 2's pattern for missing textures, models, and sounds. Never fail silently, never crash, never log per-frame.

- **Registration always returns a valid handle.** `R_LoadTexture` returns `tr.texture[TEX_PLACEHOLDER]` (magenta/black checkerboard) on file-not-found. `R_LoadModel` returns an empty zeroed `model_t`. Callers never get NULL.
- **Log once per unique asset.** Use a static `last_missing` pointer to suppress repeated warnings for the same filename. The first miss logs to stderr; subsequent misses for the same path are silent.
- **Cache the result.** Higher-level caches (UI texture arrays, configstring pic arrays, WoW `wow_ui.textures[]`) store the placeholder handle just like a successful load. The next lookup for the same name returns the cached placeholder without re-probing the filesystem.
- **Do not add per-frame or per-draw warnings.** If a texture is missing, the checkerboard placeholder makes it visually obvious. Warnings belong at registration time only.
- **Do not add local null-check guards for textures returned by `R_LoadTexture`.** The function guarantees a valid pointer. Code that checks `if (!tex)` before drawing is redundant.

## Command Conventions

- The `+` prefix (e.g. `+map`, `+menu_main`) is for **command-line arguments only**. It tells `Cbuf_AddLateCommands` to strip the `+` and queue the command for startup execution.
- In code, use the bare command name when calling `Cbuf_AddText` or `uiimport.Cmd_ExecuteText`: `"map ..."` not `"+map ..."`. The `+` prefix causes `Cmd_ForwardToServer` to reject the command.
- Same for the console: type `map Maps\Campaign\Orc01.w3m`, not `+map`.

## Domain

- This is a **real-time strategy game** (RTS), so game logic should account for unit management, pathfinding, resource gathering, building construction, and large numbers of entities — adapted from the Quake 2/3 entity/server model where applicable.

## MPQ Inspection Workflow

- When investigating Warcraft III assets, prefer using the local CLI utility `build/bin/mpqtool` instead of guessing file paths.
- Never define in C code any UI/layout/asset values that can be read from MPQ data files such as XML, Lua, FDF, DBC, SLK, or similar. Build or extend systems that load and use the authoritative MPQ data instead of embedding fallback literals in engine code.
- Tests must not depend on a developer's local Warcraft III data or `War3.mpq`. Add any archive fixtures under `tests/resources-src`, pack them into the generated `build/tests/tests.mpq` through `make test-assets`, and point tests at that fixture MPQ instead.
- Tests must not read from ignored local extraction folders such as `data/fdf` or `data/Warcraft III`. If a test needs FDF, map, texture, model, or other archive content, copy the minimal fixture into `tests/resources-src`, add it to `build/tests/tests.mpq`, and read it from that generated archive.
- When a test fixture intentionally replaces an actual game archive file with custom content, use the same archive path and filename as the real game file. Do not invent project-specific replacement names for files that are meant to stand in for game files; keep the name WoW/Warcraft-style and make only the contents custom.
- Use `ls` mode to browse archive structure incrementally:
	- `build/bin/mpqtool -mpq <path-to-mpq> ls`
	- `build/bin/mpqtool -mpq <path-to-mpq> ls <subdir>`
- Use `cat` mode to dump file contents to stdout so output can be piped or redirected:
	- `build/bin/mpqtool -mpq <path-to-mpq> cat <archive-file>`
	- Example with redirect: `build/bin/mpqtool -mpq <path-to-mpq> cat Scripts/war3map.j > /tmp/war3map.j`
- Normalize slashes as needed when querying paths; both `\` and `/` are accepted by the tool input.
- For agent workflows, default to this tool whenever you need to discover MPQ contents, inspect text assets, or extract raw file bytes for analysis.

## WoW Character Display Workflow

- Do not fix WoW character clothing, hair, or appearance bugs by hardcoding one model path, one race, one item texture set, or one group of M2 skin sections in engine code. Character appearance is data-driven by M2 skin section IDs plus DBC display records.
- For player/NPC character models, inspect `CharSections.dbc`, `CharHairGeosets.dbc`, `CharHairTextures.dbc`, `CharStartOutfit.dbc`, `ItemDisplayInfo.dbc`, and `HelmetGeosetVisData.dbc` before changing renderer policy. Local DBC files live under `DBFilesClient` in the WoW MPQs and can be inspected with `build/bin/mpqtool`.
- Some classic-era DBCs have a logical field count that is larger than `record_size / 4`; for example local `CharStartOutfit.dbc` reports 41 fields with 152-byte records. Parse DBC records by validating the file envelope and checking each accessed field against `record_size`, not by rejecting the whole file when `field_count * 4` exceeds `record_size`.
- `ItemDisplayInfo.dbc` carries item model names/textures, geoset groups, flags, helmet visibility, and eight character texture component slots. In the local classic-era 23-field layout, texture components start at field 14; in the documented 25-field TBC/Wrath layout, they start at field 15. The component slots map to upper arm, lower arm, hand, upper torso, lower torso, upper leg, lower leg, and foot.
- M2 skin section IDs are grouped by hundreds. Character renderers should select one variant per relevant group at draw time or through a variant cache keyed by appearance/equipment, not by throwing away sections at model-load time. Loading all batches preserves future per-entity equipment changes.
- Do not infer visible geosets from non-empty component textures. WoW keeps default character geosets such as gloves/boots/ears/sleeves/legs/robe/pelvis visible unless item geoset groups override them; item component texture stems are normally pasted into a composed character skin texture. The `whoa-master` component path documents defaults in `ComponentData.hpp` and applies them in `CCharacterComponent::GeosRenderPrep`.
- Component texture names in `ItemDisplayInfo.dbc` are stems, not full archive paths. Resolve them under `Item\TextureComponents\<slot-folder>\` and try gender-specific suffixes (`_M`, `_F`) before universal (`_U`) where the archive contains universal components.
- The whoa-master character component rectangles are documented in 512x512 atlas space. Classic body skins such as `Character\Orc\Male\OrcMaleSkin00_00.blp` may be 256x256, so scale component paste rectangles to the actual destination body texture size before compositing. Otherwise all right-half slots such as torso, pants, boots, and feet land outside the texture and silently disappear.
- The current packed WoW `equipment` bytes are local slot item indices, not raw item IDs. Treat each byte as an index into a WoW-owned 256-entry item list selected by race, gender, and slot, with index `0` meaning empty and nonzero indices resolving through DBC-backed `ItemDisplayInfo` display IDs in renderer/tool code. Keep the game state packed with `Wow_PackEquipment(...)` rather than widening entity/player state for preview gear.
- Grounded WoW actors must use the same one-dimensional yaw path as Warcraft III/OpenWarcraft3 entities: game code writes `entityState_t.angle` in radians, the client interpolates it with `LerpRotation(...)`, and grounded M2 rendering consumes `renderEntity_t.angle`. Do not put player/creature yaw back into `entityState_t.rotation` or interpolate a 3D rotation vector for dynamic actors; `rotation` is reserved for static object/model transforms that genuinely need three axes.

## DBC Inspection Workflow (dbctool)

- Use `build/bin/dbctool` to inspect or create WoW DBC files without writing C code or running the game.
- DBCs live inside WoW MPQ archives under `DBFilesClient\`. You can also pass a raw extracted file with `-file`.
- CLI synopsis:
    - `build/bin/dbctool -mpq <archive.mpq> info <DBFilesClient\File.dbc>`
    - `build/bin/dbctool -mpq <archive.mpq> dump <DBFilesClient\File.dbc> [max-rows]`
    - `build/bin/dbctool -mpq <archive.mpq> get  <DBFilesClient\File.dbc> <row> <field>`
    - `build/bin/dbctool -mpq <archive.mpq> str  <DBFilesClient\File.dbc> <row> <field>`
    - `build/bin/dbctool -file <file.dbc>   info|dump|get|str ...`

Commands:
- `info` — print header: record count, field count, record size, string block size.
- `dump` — print all (or up to `max-rows`) records as tab-separated uint32 columns, one row per line.
- `get  r f` — print field `f` of row `r` (0-based) as a uint32. Use for ID, flags, or integer columns.
- `str  r f` — resolve field `f` of row `r` as a string-block offset and print the string. Use for name/filename columns.

Examples:
```
build/bin/dbctool -mpq data/world-of-warcraft/Data/patch.mpq info DBFilesClient\\ChrRaces.dbc
build/bin/dbctool -mpq data/world-of-warcraft/Data/patch.mpq dump DBFilesClient\\ChrClasses.dbc 10
build/bin/dbctool -mpq data/world-of-warcraft/Data/patch.mpq get  DBFilesClient\\ChrRaces.dbc 0 0
build/bin/dbctool -mpq data/world-of-warcraft/Data/patch.mpq str  DBFilesClient\\ChrRaces.dbc 0 17
build/bin/dbctool -file /tmp/ChrRaces.dbc dump
```

### Writing DBC files for tests

Use `create`, `set`, `setstr`, and `save` to build fixture DBCs for unit tests. No `-mpq` or `-file` prefix needed.

Write commands:
- `create <out.dbc> <fields> <record_size>` — create an empty DBC (record_size must be 4× fields).
- `set <file.dbc> <row> <field> <value>` — set a uint32 field. Row is auto-created.
- `setstr <file.dbc> <row> <field> <string>` — set a string field (value stored in string block).
- `save <file.dbc>` — write the in-memory DBC to disk and clean up.

Example:
```
build/bin/dbctool create /tmp/test.dbc 3 12
build/bin/dbctool set /tmp/test.dbc 0 0 1
build/bin/dbctool setstr /tmp/test.dbc 0 1 "Hello"
build/bin/dbctool set /tmp/test.dbc 0 2 42
build/bin/dbctool save /tmp/test.dbc
build/bin/dbctool -file /tmp/test.dbc dump
```

This creates a 3-field, 12-byte/record DBC with 1 row. String fields are automatically collected into the string block on `save`.

When to use dbctool:
- Before hardcoding any race/class/faction/item/display ID or name in C or Lua: confirm the real value by querying the authoritative DBC.
- When debugging character creation (`ChrRaces.dbc`, `ChrClasses.dbc`, `CharBaseInfo.dbc`), faction assignment (`FactionTemplate.dbc`, `FactionGroup.dbc`), outfit display (`CharStartOutfit.dbc`, `ItemDisplayInfo.dbc`), or geoset visibility (`CharSections.dbc`, `CharHairGeosets.dbc`).
- To determine field layout before writing or updating a DBC loader in `ui_dbc.c` or the renderer: run `info` to get field count and record size, then `dump 1` to see the first row's raw uint32 values, then `str` to identify which columns are string offsets.
- Prefer `info` first, then `str` for named fields, then `dump` when you need the full picture.
- Pipe `dump` output through `grep`, `awk`, or `cut` for quick filtering (e.g. find all rows where field 0 equals a specific race ID).
- Use `create`/`set`/`setstr`/`save` to generate minimal DBC fixtures for tests that exercise DBC-dependent code paths.

Agent guidance:
- Always use this tool when investigating a DBC layout mismatch or verifying field indices documented in comments in `ui_dbc.c`.
- Do not hardcode field indices in C code without first confirming them with `dbctool info` and `dbctool dump`.

## MDX Inspection Workflow (mdxtool)

- Use `build/bin/mdxtool` to validate MDX assets and detect data problems before debugging render code.
- CLI synopsis:
	- `build/bin/mdxtool -mpq <path-to-mpq> -model <archive-model-path> [--anim <sequence>] [--use-model-camera] [--front-ortho] [--info] [--dump-all] [--once]`
- Viewer mode (opens window):
	- `build/bin/mdxtool -mpq <path-to-mpq> -model <archive-model-path>`
	- Example: `build/bin/mdxtool -mpq data/Warcraft\ III/War3.mpq -model UI\Glues\MainMenu\WarCraftIIILogo\WarCraftIIILogo.mdx`
- Front-ortho viewer mode for flat UI layers:
	- `build/bin/mdxtool -mpq <path-to-mpq> -model <archive-model-path> --front-ortho`
	- Example: `build/bin/mdxtool -mpq data/Warcraft\ III/War3.mpq -model UI\Glues\SpriteLayers\TopRightPanel.mdx --front-ortho`
- Info mode (no window, stdout only):
	- `build/bin/mdxtool -mpq <path-to-mpq> -model <archive-model-path> --info`

Common flags:
- `--anim <sequence>`: render or inspect a specific sequence by name, e.g. `--anim "MainMenu Stand"`.
- `--use-model-camera`: prefer the first embedded MDX camera when present.
- `--front-ortho`: use a front-facing orthographic preview camera for flat UI models without useful embedded cameras.
- `--info`: print model metadata and chunk counts without opening a window.
- `--dump-all`: print loaded model details including nodes, bones, geosets, materials, and cameras.
- `--once`: render one frame and exit; useful for scripted diagnostics and agent workflows.

When to use `--info`:
- Confirm the model exists and loads from MPQ path.
- Check whether a model has cameras (`CAMS`) for portrait/model-camera paths.
- Check sequence counts (`SEQS`) for Birth/Stand/Death animation expectations.
- Check textures (`TEXS`) and pivots (`PIVT`) for basic model completeness.
- Check optional systems that often explain missing visuals:
	- lights (`LITE`)
	- particle emitters (`PRE2`)
	- attachments (`ATCH`)
	- helpers (`HELP`)
	- bones (`BONE`)
	- collision shapes (`CLID`)
	- geosets (`GEOS`) and geoset anims (`GEOA`)

Expected output style:
- `mdxtool --info: model=<path> size=<bytes>`
- one line per relevant chunk with counts, e.g. `SEQS: count=...`, `CAMS: count=...`, `LITE: count=...`.

Agent guidance:
- Prefer `--info` first for existence, chunk counts, and camera availability.
- Use `--dump-all --once` when chunk summaries are not enough and you need loaded geoset, material, bone, or animation-state details.
- Use `--front-ortho` for glue sprites, panel layers, logos, and other flat UI-facing models.
- Use `--use-model-camera` only when the model actually contains a useful embedded camera.

Use this output in bug reports/diagnostics so rendering issues can be triaged from data facts (camera/lights/particles/sequence availability) without requiring screenshots.

## MDX Animation Reference (WarsmashModEngine)

The `data/WarsmashModEngine/` directory contains a Java port of the mdx-m3-viewer used as
reference for MDX animation behaviour.  Key differences from our C implementation:

- **Keyframe wrapping** (`SdSequence.getValue` in `AnimatedObject.java`): when the animation
  frame exceeds the last keyframe within the sequence interval, the game interpolates from
  the last keyframe's value back toward the first keyframe's value — it does NOT clamp to
  the last pose.
- **Per-sequence keyframe filtering**: Warsmash builds a separate filtered keyframe list for
  each sequence at load time (`SdSequence` constructor), selecting keyframes with
  `start <= frame <= end` (inclusive).  Our code filters at evaluation time with exclusive
  upper bound.

When investigating animation crop/truncation bugs, the relevant source files are:
- `data/WarsmashModEngine/.../mdx/AnimatedObject.java`
- `data/WarsmashModEngine/.../mdx/SdSequence.java`
- `data/WarsmashModEngine/.../mdx/Sd.java`
- `data/WarsmashModEngine/.../mdx/MdxComplexInstance.java` (updateAnimations method)

## UI Text Renderer Workflow

- Use `make run-ui-text` to inspect client-side UI rendering without opening a window or taking screenshots.
- Default command:
	- `make run-ui-text UI_CMD=menu_main`
- Equivalent explicit command:
	- `build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data data/Warcraft\ III +r_module stdout +com_frame_limit 1 +menu_main`
- `+r_module stdout` selects the text renderer.
- Menu-only diagnostics do not enter LAN browser/connect/host paths, so UDP sockets are not opened.
- `+com_frame_limit 1` exits after one frame and skips writing `share/config.cfg`.

Expected output includes:
- `load_texture`, `load_model`, `load_font`
- `draw_portrait`, `draw_sprite`
- `draw_image` with texture name, screen rect, UV rect, blend mode, color, rotation
- `draw_text` with font, rect, measured size, color, translated text
- `draw_sys_text` for console overlay output

Agent guidance:
- Prefer the stdout renderer first for UI layout, FDF translation, button state, backdrop tiling, UV, color-code, and menu-command composition bugs.
- Use `mdxtool --info` first when a UI model itself may be missing or malformed.
- `fdftool` is no longer the primary UI inspection path; Phase 8 moved UI rendering into the client-side UI library.
- For in-game HUD diagnostics (resource bar, command buttons, info panels), the ConsoleUI screen controller in `ui/screens/console_ui.c` draws via `UI_DrawFrames()`. Use the stdout renderer to inspect its FDF binding and frame output.
- For startup-menu diagnostics, invoke a concrete menu command directly with a leading `+`. UI navigation is command-based; do not add router-style paths such as `/credits` or `/options`, do not add a generic `ui` console command, and do not add startup cvars for menu routing. Register concrete menu commands such as `menu_credits` or `menu_options` instead. Examples:
	- `build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data data/Warcraft\ III +menu_main`
	- `build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data data/Warcraft\ III +menu_single_player_campaign`
	- `make run-ui-text UI_CMD=menu_single_player_campaign`

## Time Profiler Workflow

- For runtime CPU profiling on macOS, prefer Instruments `xctrace` with the local `xctraceprof` parser.
- Record a real run with Time Profiler:
	- `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xctrace record --template "Time Profiler" --time-limit 20s --output /private/tmp/openwarcraft3-orc01.trace --launch -- /Users/igor/Developer/openwarcraft3/build/bin/openwarcraft3 -data "/Users/igor/Developer/openwarcraft3/data/Warcraft III" +map "Maps\\Campaign\\Orc01.w3m"`
- Export the time-profile table to XML:
	- `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xctrace export --input /private/tmp/openwarcraft3-orc01.trace --xpath '/trace-toc/run[@number="1"]/data/table[@schema="time-profile"]' > /private/tmp/openwarcraft3-orc01-timeprof.xml`
- Summarize the relevant window and focus symbols:
	- `build/bin/xctraceprof --window 8:18 --top 25 /private/tmp/openwarcraft3-orc01-timeprof.xml`
	- `build/bin/xctraceprof --window 8:18 --focus R_RenderFogOfWar --top 25 /private/tmp/openwarcraft3-orc01-timeprof.xml`
	- `build/bin/xctraceprof --window 8:18 --focus SV_Frame --top 20 /private/tmp/openwarcraft3-orc01-timeprof.xml`
- Use `R_RenderFogOfWar` when investigating legacy renderer-owned fog work, `CL_ParseFogOfWar` / `R_SetFogOfWarData` for client texture upload, and `SV_Frame` / `G_FowUpdate` when investigating server/game tick work such as authoritative fog, movement, and snapshots.

## UI Screen Authoring Conventions

- In client/UI code, never define or hardcode UI elements, layout coordinates, textures, frame names, or control structures that can be read from FDF. Parse and reuse the actual FDF frames/templates, then bind dynamic data into those frames.
- The only exception is selected game code under `games/<game>/game/`, where there is no FDF parser. Server-authored gameplay HUD payloads may generate simple proxy frames there when needed.
- In `games/warcraft-3/ui/screens/*.c`, prefer `UI_FRAME(...)` and `UI_CHILD_FRAME(...)` for readability and FDF-name coupling.
- Use `UI_FindChildFrame(...)` when it is clearly shorter or cleaner than introducing temporary macro-bound locals.
- Avoid excessive pointer null-check noise in screen controllers. Prefer one scene-level readiness gate (early return) over repeated per-widget checks.
- If a required root frame is missing, fail fast for that screen and skip further scene setup/update work.
- Keep frame names data-driven by FDF and avoid hardcoded lookup strings when macro-based lookup can use the frame identifier directly.

### ConsoleUI Screen Controller (In-Game HUD)

- `ui/screens/console_ui.c` is the client-side replacement for the server-authored `hud/hud.c` HUD.
- Loads Blizzard's ConsoleUI.fdf, ResourceBar.fdf, UpperButtonBar.fdf, InfoPanelUnitDetail.fdf, InfoPanelBuildingDetail.fdf, InfoPanelItemDetail.fdf, and SimpleInfoPanel.fdf from MPQ at runtime via `UI_EnsureFDF()`.
- Binds player state (gold, lumber, food) via `uiimport.GetPlayerState()`.
- Receives unit selection/command data via `update_unit_ui` callback from `svc_unit_ui` messages.
- Draw path: `UI_DrawFrames()` renders FDF FRAMEDEF trees. This is the only draw path for the in-game HUD.
- Wire into game mode via `UI_EnterGameMode()` in `ui_main.c`, which calls `consoleUIScreen.load()` and `consoleUIScreen.init()`. The `UI_RefreshLocal()` and `UI_UpdateUnitUILocal()` functions route to the screen during game mode.

## Entity Sound Architecture

Unit sounds fire via a one-shot event mechanism mirroring Quake 2/3's `s.event` pattern:

1. **Server (game code):** At spawn, `G_RegisterUnitSounds` reads the unit's `usnd` label from `unitUI.slk`, looks it up in `UI/SoundInfo/UnitAckSounds.slk`, and calls `gi.SoundIndex(path)` to register the file path as a configstring.  The returned index is cached in `edict->sound_attack` / `edict->sound_death`.
2. **Trigger:** On attack swing, `s.event = EV_ATTACK; s.sound = sound_attack`.  On death, `s.event = EV_DEATH; s.sound = sound_death`.  Both are cleared to zero at the start of every `G_RunEntities` frame so they fire for exactly one snapshot.
3. **Client:** `CL_ReadPacketEntities` calls `CL_EntityEvent(ent)` when `ent->event != 0`.  It resolves `cl.configstrings[CS_SOUNDS + ent->sound]` to a file path and calls `S_PlaySoundFile(path)`.

### Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `common/shared.h` | `entity_event_t` enum (`EV_NONE`, `EV_ATTACK`, `EV_DEATH`, `EV_MOVE`) |
| `games/warcraft-3/game/g_monster.c` | `G_RegisterUnitSounds` — spawns sound indices from SLK |
| `games/warcraft-3/game/m_unit.c` | `unit_die` — sets `EV_DEATH` event |
| `games/warcraft-3/game/skills/s_attack.c` | `attack_melee`/`attack_ranged` — sets `EV_ATTACK` event |
| `games/warcraft-3/game/g_events.c` | `G_RunEntities` — clears `s.event`/`s.sound` each frame |
| `client/cl_fx.c` | `CL_EntityEvent` — maps event to `S_PlaySoundFile` |
| `client/cl_parse.c` | Calls `CL_EntityEvent` after each entity delta |
| `sound/s_sound.c` | `S_PlaySoundFile(path)` — raw MPQ path playback |

### WC3 Sound Table Investigation

- `UI/SoundInfo/UnitAckSounds.slk` — columns: row key = `{label}{Suffix}`, `FileNames` (comma-separated), `DirectoryBase`.
- `UI/SoundInfo/UnitCombatSounds.slk` — same schema; combat impact sounds by weapon/armor type.
- Unit label: `unitUI.slk` column `unitSound` (field key `"usnd"`), e.g. `"Footman"`.
- Death sounds are raw files: `{modelDir}\{ModelName}Death.wav` (not in the SLK).
- Use `build/bin/mpqtool` to inspect: `cat "UI/SoundInfo/UnitAckSounds.slk"` and grep for the label.

See per-game sound documentation in:
- `doc/games/warcraft-3/docs/sounds.md`
- `doc/games/starcraft-2/docs/sounds.md`
- `doc/games/world-of-warcraft/docs/sounds.md`

## Documentation Discipline

- When implementing or changing a feature, always add or adjust agent-friendly documentation in this file (AGENTS.md) if the change introduces a new workflow, tool, convention, or subsystem that an agent would need to know about.
- If the feature has a dedicated workflow section (e.g. "MPQ Inspection Workflow", "DBC Inspection Workflow"), update that section rather than creating a new one.
- If the feature is a new subsystem or introduces a new pattern, add a brief section describing the architecture, the key files involved, and how to inspect/debug/test the feature.
- Keep documentation concise and actionable — prefer command examples and file paths over prose.

## GitHub Issues

- Before creating a GitHub issue, check available labels with `gh label list`.
- When creating issues, assign appropriate labels (e.g. `enhancement`, `warcraft-3`, `world-of-warcraft`, `renderer`, `ui`).
- If a needed label doesn't exist, create it first with `gh label create`.
- Keep issue titles at most 80 characters.
- Keep issues scoped to one game/title when possible; use game-specific labels (`warcraft-3`, `world-of-warcraft`).
- Use `renderer` for rendering subsystem issues, `ui` for user interface issues.
